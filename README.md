# Unity Hand Tracking Simulation
This project demonstrates how Unity can interact with a Hand Tracking Camera using a Python-based application.

## Setup
1. Navigate to the HandTracking folder:
```bash
cd /path/to/project-folder/HandTracking
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Hand Tracking Camera python app:
```bash
python main.py
```
4. Set up the web camera and press start button.
5. Now open the Unity project in your Unity Editor and play the `UnityHandTracking` scene to begin the simulation.
